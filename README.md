##### Chapter 6 â€“ day 1

1. Write a function corners() that will take two parameters m and n and returns a string with m+1 plus signs each of which 
are separated by n dashes. So corners(3,2) would return +--+--+--+ and corners(1,5) would return +-----+

2. Write a function vertical() that will take two parameters m and n and returns a string with m+1 vertical bars each of 
which are separated by n spaces. So vertical(3,2) would return 
```
|  |  |  |
```
and vertical(1,5) would return 
```
|     |
```

3. Write a function boxes(m,n,o,p) which will return a box (as a string) divided into m boxes horizontally each of which are n dashes wide, and o boxes vertically each of which has p vertical dashes.   

box(3,4,2,5) 

should return the string that when printed that gives 3 boxes horizontally with width 4 dashes and 2 boxes vertically with height 5.
